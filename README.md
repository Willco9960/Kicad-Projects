# README

## Overview

This folder contains a collection of projects I have designed using **KiCad**, an open-source software suite for electronic design automation (EDA). These projects are part of my ongoing effort to strengthen my skills and expand my knowledge in electronic circuit design and hardware development.

## Purpose

- **Skill Development:** Each project focuses on different aspects of circuit design, from schematic capture to PCB layout, helping me improve my proficiency in KiCad.
  
- **Knowledge Expansion:** By working on varied projects, I aim to deepen my understanding of electronics concepts and hardware engineering principles.

## Project List

Each subfolder within this directory represents a unique project. Project documentation, schematics, PCB layouts, and any related files are organized accordingly.

## Tools Used

- **KiCad**  â€“ for schematic design and PCB layout

## Future Work

I will continue to add more projects to this folder as I explore new concepts and tackle more complex designs.
