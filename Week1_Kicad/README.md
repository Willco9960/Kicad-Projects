# Digital Logic Design Final Project

This repository contains a recreation of my final project in Digital Logic Design. It includes:

- **Bill of Materials (BOM):** A detailed list of components used in the design.
- **3D Render:** A visual representation of the completed circuit design.
- **Schematic Sheet:** The full schematic diagram illustrating the logic circuit.

## Files
